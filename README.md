# Project - April

The genre of the game I created is a 'Restaurant Management Game'. I took inspiration from a game named 'Plate Up'. The purpose of the game is to survive by handling numerous customer orders. Customers arrive and place their orders, and players must prepare the food before their patience drops to 0, making them angry and causing them to leave.
