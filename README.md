# Project - April(Plate Up)

The genre of the game I created is a 'Restaurant Management Game'. I took inspiration from a game named 'Plate Up'. The purpose of the game is to survive by handling numerous customer orders. Customers arrive and place their orders, and players must prepare the food before their patience drops to 0, making them angry and causing them to leave.

## Cooking System

Player must prepare the food the customer desires and bring it to them.  
Each menu item has its own recipe.

## Customer 

### Group System

People sit with their own group. If someone comes alone, they sit by themselves and do not share a seat with others.

### Order

When customers take their seats, they wait to order. Their patience gauge decreases from the moment they sit down.

### Get Food

When the player approaches a customer to take their order, the customer selects a food item from the menu. An image of the chosen food then appears as a UI element above their head.

### Leave

When the player prepares the correct food and serves it to the customer, the customer eats, pays the bill, and then leaves the restaurant.

### Waiting Cycle

If the tables are full, customers wait outside. When space becomes available, the waiting customers come in, and those in line move forward to fill empty spaces.

## Waitress System

### Take Order

Waitress takes order instead of player.

### Serve Food

If the player places food on the waitress's table, the waitress comes to get it, determines which customer ordered it, and then serves the food.

### Discard Food

If a player leaves food that no one has ordered on the waitress table, the waiter will throw away the food and return the dish to the dish table.
